# Description
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example 1:
```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

Note:
1. The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
2. The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
