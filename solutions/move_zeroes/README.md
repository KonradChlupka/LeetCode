# Description
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

Note:
1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.
